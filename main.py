prompt = f'''You are a video scriptwriter for short educational YouTube videos.

Your job is to generate a concise and clear script for a short video based on the following :

eg. How to make money as a developer

Break the topic down into 5 to 7 actionable, logical steps. Each step should be written like a scene in a video: what the narrator would say and what the viewer would see.

Each step should be:
- Simple and clear (aimed at beginners)
- One sentence describing the narration
- One sentence describing the visual content
- Include 1â€“2 relevant keywords for stock footage

Format your output as a JSON array of steps like this:


  
   "narration": "Start by choosing a programming language to master.",
    "visual": "Show a developer browsing programming languages.",
    "keywords": ["programming", "developer"]
title: {title}
